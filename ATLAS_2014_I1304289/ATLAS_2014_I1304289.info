Description:
"Normalized differential distributions as functions of hadronically decaying top quark $p_T$ and ttbar system mass, $p_T$ and absolute rapidity are plotted for top quark pair production events in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $7 \text{TeV}$. The distributions are normalized to remove sensitivity to the total cross-section. Only semileptonic events are used and so this analysis is sensitive to BSM modifications which only effect semileptonic decays."

 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
