Title: "Measurement of the semileptonic ttbar + gamma production cross
       section in pp collisions at $ \sqrt{s}=8 $ TeV}""
Notes: No hepdata entry!
Particle/fiducial: fiducial cross section of ttbar + gamma is measured in the semileptonic channel
                   in a kinematic region defined for decay products including a hard photon
