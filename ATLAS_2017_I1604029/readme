Title: "Measurment of the ttbar gamma prouction cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=8TeV with the ATLAS detector"
This analysis presents the inclusive fiducial ttbar gamma cross section measured in the single lepton channel. It also presents the differential cross sections measured in the fiducial region as a function of the photon pT and pseudorapidity.

One lepton is required, one high energy photon and four jets with at least one b-tagged jet. 
Leptons are dressed and removed from the jet clustering (ie the bare leptons and associated photons are removed).
There are various isolation requirements on the leptons, photons and jets. 
particle-level objects are removed (the fiducial region is defined at particle level).

NOTES:
Of all ttbar events on. about 20% are faililing the electron/muon pt cut of pt>25GeV (about 1% fail the abseta cut). This is prior to any object removal!

Question: should we use decay photons on dressed leptons? YES! These are (from rivet comments) "non-prompt photons"

Q: do we need heParticles AND the bool use decay photons? becuas ethey both are trying to get ride of (check!) photons from hadronic decays?
