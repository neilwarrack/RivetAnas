THERE IS ALREADY A RIVET WRITTEN FOR THIS!!!!!

NB: there is a mistake in the paper! The jet removal should proceed as stated in the Rivet (see above) not the paper (ie it's all jets within some deltaR, not "the closest jet" within some deltaR of a photo/electron)


Paper Title: "Measurment of the ttbar gamma prouction cross section in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=8TeV with the ATLAS detector"

Results:
This analysis presents the inclusive fiducial ttbar gamma cross section measured in the single lepton channel. It also presents the differential cross sections measured in the fiducial region as a function of the photon pT and (absolute) pseudorapidity.

Event selection:
One lepton is required, one high energy photon and four jets with at least one b-tagged jet. 
Leptons are dressed and removed from the jet clustering (ie the bare leptons and associated photons are removed).
There are various isolation requirements on the leptons, photons and jets. 
particle-level objects are removed (the fiducial region is defined at particle level).
