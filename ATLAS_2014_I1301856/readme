there is a hepdata entry for this paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5375
https://hepdata.net/record/ins1301856

...but the total cross section measurements aren't there (the main results of the paper) and neither are 4 fiducial cross-section measuments which are presented in table 8 (printed after the addendum, but mentioned in the main paper). These results should idealy be included too.
